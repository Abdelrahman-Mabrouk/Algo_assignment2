## **Project Description**

### **Part 1: Hashing Techniques and Collision Resolution**
Develop C++ implementations for various hashing techniques and methods to resolve collisions efficiently:

#### **Hashing Techniques**:
1. **Division Method**  
2. **Multiplication Method**  
3. **Mid-Square Method**  
4. **Folding Method**

#### **Collision Resolution Methods**:
1. **Chaining Method**  
2. **Open Addressing Method**  
3. **Double Hashing**

### **Part 2: Red-Black Tree**
Implement a Red-Black Tree in C++ to support:
1. **Insertion**: Add nodes while maintaining tree balance and color properties.  
2. **Deletion**: Remove nodes with restructuring to preserve Red-Black Tree properties.

This ensures the tree operates efficiently and adheres to the rules of Red-Black Trees.

### **Part 3: Skip List Implementation**
#### **Part A: Core Implementation**
Design a Skip List data structure in C++ to support:
1. **Insertion**: Insert elements while maintaining probabilistic balancing.  
2. **Deletion**: Remove elements efficiently.  
3. **Search**: Quickly locate elements.

#### **Part B: Real-Life Application**
Use the Skip List implementation to manage dynamic player scores in a multiplayer game. The implementation should include:
1. **Dynamic Score Updates**: Handle frequent changes in player scores efficiently.  
2. **Leaderboard Retrieval**: Provide quick access to the top N players.  
3. **Player Management**: Allow players to join and leave the game dynamically, and access their scores anytime.
